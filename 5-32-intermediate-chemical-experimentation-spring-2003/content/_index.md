5.32 involves more advanced experimental work than 5.310 or 5.311. The course emphasizes organic synthesis assisted by chiral catalysis, purification, and analysis of organic compounds employing such methods as IR, 1D and 2D NMR, UV spectroscopies and mass spectrometry, and thin layer and non-chiral and chiral gas chromatography. In 5.32, experiments also involve enzyme purification, characterization and assays, as well as molecular modeling in organic synthesis and in biochemical systems.
